# QkvRmsNormRopeCacheWithKScale Task Plan

## Rules

1. Work on `master` in this repository.
2. Complete tasks in dependency order.
3. Every task must leave the repository compiling.
4. Host-side tasks require UT coverage.
5. Kernel synchronization tasks currently require compile verification and
   static protocol review; sync-specific tests can be added later.
6. After a task is coded and verified, update this file and commit the task.

## Status

| ID | Task | Status | Verification | Commit |
|----|------|--------|--------------|--------|
| S00 | Create implementation scaffold | Done | Top-level CMake configure reached this no-op directory; configure then failed in pre-existing mc2/ffn targets unrelated to this scaffold | Included in scaffold commit |
| T00 | Host checker/tiling contract + UT | Done | Sourced `/usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.1.0/set_env.sh` and passed `bash build.sh --ophost_test --ops=qkv_rms_norm_rope_cache_with_kscale --soc=ascend950 -j8`; 9 host UT passed. `--noexec` host UT compile also passed | Included in T00 commit and host UT build.sh fix commit |
| T01 | Controller and basic block skeleton | Not started | Kernel compile | |
| T02 | AIV local slice and tail row range | Not started | Kernel compile + Host UT extension | |
| T03 | Static buffer and tensor binding | Not started | Kernel compile | |
| T04 | CrossCore wrappers and flag ids | Not started | Kernel compile + static review | |
| T05 | Intra-core event constants and Init/End | Not started | Kernel compile + event id static check | |
| T06 | AIV Q/K/V preprocess | Not started | Kernel compile + preprocess UT | |
| T07 | AIC rotation resident and Cube matmul | Not started | Kernel compile + Cube UT | |
| T08 | AIC Fixpipe distribution and C_READY | Not started | Kernel compile + static review | |
| T09 | V branch early postprocess | Not started | Kernel compile + V path UT | |
| T10 | AIV Q/K postprocess | Not started | Kernel compile + Q/K postprocess UT | |
| T11 | Rolling pipeline and drain | Not started | Kernel compile + static review | |
| T12 | Tail and empty-slice synchronization | Not started | Kernel compile + Host UT extension | |
| T13 | Synchronization protocol audit | Not started | Kernel compile + static audit | |
| T14 | Kernel UT/ST closure | Not started | Full UT/ST | |

## Next Task

T01 is the next implementation task. It should add the kernel controller and
basic block skeleton that consume the T00 tiling contract without adding the
full compute body yet.
